Work in progress to develop an aesthetically pleasing site for my girlfriend's photography business.
The site will funtion as a portfolio of her previous work and guide users toward contacting her to conduct business.

Plans for next version:
-Remove drop down menu. All information (especially Pricing) should be on main navigation bar.
-Create side navigation bar of different photography works. Position on left.
-Hovering over side navigation should highlight.
-Clicking side navigation should scroll to associated image location.
-The currently selected side navigation should stay highlighted.
-Scrolling through changes the selected side navigation.
-Hovering over image block toggles slideshow of images of that type of work.
-Facebook icon included in main navigation bar.
-Create third column of blocks on the right positioned next to images entitled "see more ->".
-The "see more ->" blocks should be invisible unless at the chosen work section.
-"see more ->" should link to a more robust gallery of photos of the chosen work.
